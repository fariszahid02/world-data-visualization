# üåç World Data 2023: Interactive Visualizations

This project explores the 2023 world dataset through a series of data cleaning and interactive visualizations. The goal is to gain insights into global socioeconomic indicators such as GDP, population, life expectancy, birth rate, infant mortality, and education enrollment across different continents.

## Key Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (standardized column names, fixed data types, handled missing values)
- Added a `Continent` attribute for geographical grouping
- Created interactive visualizations using Altair:
  - **Choropleth Map + Bar Chart** for GDP and Population
  - **Scatter Plot** for Life Expectancy vs. Birth Rate with Infant Mortality
  - **Faceted Bar Chart** for average Primary and Tertiary Education enrollment by continent
- Exported the full visualization dashboard to an HTML file

## Dataset

- Source: `world-data-2023_new.xlsx`
- Cleaned version saved as `world_data_cleaned.csv`

## Output

- `Visualizations.html`: Interactive dashboard with all visual insights

## Objective

To develop an interactive, clean, and insightful visual analysis pipeline from raw data through transformation to visualization‚Äîhighlighting key global patterns in development and demographics.
